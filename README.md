Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers globally, and early detection through machine learning models can significantly improve survival rates. However, lung cancer datasets are often imbalanced, with a higher number of non-cancerous cases compared to cancerous ones, which leads to biased models favoring the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is widely used to handle imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic samples for the minority class, enhancing model performance.

Key Concepts:

Imbalanced Dataset: The lung cancer dataset typically contains more non-cancerous cases than cancerous ones, leading to biased predictions.

SMOTE Variants:
Original SMOTE: Generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples.

Borderline-SMOTE: Focuses on generating synthetic samples near the decision boundary.

ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling): Emphasizes difficult-to-learn examples by generating more synthetic samples in regions with high classification difficulty.

SMOTE-NC: Handles both continuous and categorical features in the dataset.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under the Curve) are used to assess the effectiveness of SMOTE techniques in improving model performance on imbalanced lung cancer datasets.

Model Impact: Comparing different SMOTE techniques provides insights into which method yields the best performance for lung cancer classification, balancing sensitivity to cancer detection and overall model accuracy.
